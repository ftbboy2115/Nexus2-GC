## 📋 Audit Items

- [x] **ADR showing 0.0% — FIXED** — Root cause: `unified.py:75` had `>= 50` threshold
  - **Fix (Jan 7):** Changed to dynamic `>= min(10, limit//2)` - commit `14eb988`
  - FMP was returning valid 25-bar data but unified adapter incorrectly fell back to Alpaca (1 bar)
- [x] **DB session context managers — COMPLETE** — All routes now use `with get_session() as db:`
  - Created `get_session()` in database.py
  - Refactored all 29 instances across routes/
- [x] **`orders_filled` increment timing — FIXED** — Implemented Position State Machine (Jan 11)
  - Created `PositionStatus` enum with 6 states: `pending_fill`, `open`, `scaling`, `partial`, `closed`, `rejected`
  - Orders now start as `pending_fill`, transition to `open` only on confirmed fill
  - `orders_filled` only incremented when `result.status == "filled"`
  - Added 30-test suite for state transitions
- [ ] **API server restart** — Test ability to restart uvicorn from API without manual intervention
- [x] **Hardcoded values to settings** — max_trades_per_cycle, sim_initial_cash now configurable
- [x] **Scanner version tracking — ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** — Git hash captured in `scanner_settings` JSON
  - `execution_handler.py:120-137` captures commit hash at trade time
  - Stored in `PositionModel.scanner_settings` for each position
- [x] **Rejection logging — COMPLETE (v0.1.1)** — File-based logging with API endpoint
  - `rejection_tracker.py` - thread-safe, persists last 500 rejections
  - EP scanner integrated; `/automation/scheduler/rejections` endpoint added
- [ ] **Warrior/Broker Sync Audit** — Multiple edge cases discovered (Jan 16)
  - [x] Ghost positions in DB (EVTV) — Fixed: `close_orphaned_trades` now called on startup
  - [ ] Position below stop on sync skipped but not exited (RIOT $19.06 < $19.07)
  - [ ] Frontend shows stale positions (cache issue) — needs hard refresh
  - [ ] P&L discrepancy between UI (-$2.70) vs Alpaca (-$25.02)
  - [x] **Order ID Linkage Fix** — Root cause of data loss (Jan 17)
    - Sync now recovers existing position_id from warrior_db
    - Preserves original trigger_type through restarts
    - See [order_id_linkage_plan.md](file:///C:/Users/ftbbo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/0f443798-c140-4d29-99fc-fc284a48b8cf/order_id_linkage_plan.md)
  - Root cause: Multiple data sources (in-memory monitor vs warrior_db vs broker)
- [x] **Recovery Integrity Guards** — Ensure stop/target preserved through restarts (Jan 19)
  - DB-authoritative restoration of stop_price/target_price in `_sync_with_broker()`
  - Target sanity check prevents false partial-exit if price > target

## 📝 UI / UX

- [x] **API Usage card sync** — Verified: shows real FMP rate limit stats
- [x] **Total P&L % in Open Positions** — Already implemented (per-row + total)
- [ ] **Simulation Control Page** — Mock market GUI with clock, scenarios, event log → [Plan](docs/simulation_plan.md)
- [x] **Countdown Timer to Next Scan** — Shows time until next scan, smart weekend/holiday labels (Jan 10)
- [x] **Score Breakdown Display** — Hover tooltip on quality score shows RS%, stop%, tier (Jan 10)
- [ ] **Trade Details Deep Link** — Discord notifications link to `/trade/{id}` page with full trade history
  - Entry/exit timeline, scanner settings at entry, P/L breakdown by partial
- [x] **API Usage card not showing on VPS — FIXED** — Used Next.js proxy for API routing (commit `f199f7d`)
- [x] **Column totals on Open Positions table** — Footer row with Cost Basis, Value, P/L totals (Jan 10)
- [x] **Scheduler Last Run shows UTC — FIXED** — Now displays ET with label (Jan 10)
- [ ] **Account-Strategy Locking** — Lock navbar account dropdown to specific strategies (e.g., Account A for NAC, Account B for Warrior) to prevent accidental mixing
- [ ] **Connection Status Indicator** — Visual badge + smart event logging for backend connectivity
  - Show 🟢/🔴 badge near Refresh button for current connection state
  - Only log transitions: "❌ Failed to connect" → "✅ Connection restored"
  - Avoids log spam from repeated poll failures
- [x] **Trade History / Events Log Pagination** — Scrollable container (400px max-height) for Trade History table (Jan 14)
  - Fixed-height scrollable container shows all trades without long page scroll
- [ ] **Quality Indicator Lights** — Traffic light indicators for Warrior Watchlist & Positions cards (Jan 17)
  - Watchlist: 6 indicators (Float, RVol, Gap, Catalyst, VWAP, Entry) with tooltips
  - Positions: 8 health indicators (MACD, 9/20/200 EMA, VWAP, Volume, Stop, Target)
  - Based on Ross Cameron's methodology from "7 Candlestick Patterns" video
  - See [implementation_plan.md](file:///C:/Users/ftbbo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/0f443798-c140-4d29-99fc-fc284a48b8cf/implementation_plan.md)
  - Prevents needing to scroll past long event lists to see AI analysis
- [ ] **Smart Scheduler Interval Change** — When interval is reduced, run scan immediately if time_remaining > new_interval
- [ ] **GUI Interval Validation Fix** — Frontend rejects 5-minute interval but backend accepts [5, 10, 15, 30]

---

## 🧪 Scanner Improvements

- [x] **RS percentile calculation** — Added 6M (126d) per KK methodology
- [ ] **Setup classification tags** — Each scanner tags its type: ep, breakout, htf, flag
- [ ] **Full E2E simulation test** — After fixing HTF signal conversion
- [ ] **RVOL filtering for Breakout scanner** — Per KK methodology, breakouts should require 2-3x average volume
  - Currently only EP scanner uses RVOL; Breakout/HTF do not check volume
- [x] **ERAS miss (Jan 7) — FIXED** — Added healthcare/investor conference catalyst patterns (commit `7779556`)
  - Root cause: "Present at J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference" didn't match catalyst regex
  - Solution: Added patterns for healthcare/investor conferences, presenting at conferences
- [ ] **FMP Rate Limit Retry Queue** — Symbols that fail due to 429 errors should be queued for retry
  - Priority retry when rate limits clear
  - Staggered API requests to avoid hitting limits
  - Cross-strategy rate limit awareness (VPS KK + local Warrior share quota)
- [x] **Former Runner Score Boost** — Use former runner as score boost, not catalyst bypass (Jan 13)
  - Require real catalyst (news/earnings) to pass scanner ✅
  - If stock also has former-runner status → add +1 to quality score ✅
  - Former runner alone → still reject (no catalyst bypass) ✅
  - Per Ross Cameron research: former runner increases conviction when catalyst exists
- [x] **NAC P&L Calculation Fix** — NAC positions now correctly record realized_pnl on close (Jan 14)
  - Fixed broker sync and execute_monitor_exit to calculate P&L
- [ ] **IPO Calendar Integration** — Detect and trade newly-listed stocks (Ross Cameron trades IPOs)
  - Add FMP `/api/v3/ipo_calendar` endpoint to `fmp_adapter.py`
  - IPO catalyst score: Day 1 = +2, Days 2-7 = +1, Days 8-14 = +0
  - Tiered stop logic based on days since IPO
- [ ] **S-3 Shelf Filing Detection** — Score penalty for dilution risk (not disqualifier)
  - Add FMP `/api/v3/sec_filings/{SYMBOL}?type=S-3` endpoint
  - Recent S-3 (< 30 days) = -2, Active (30-365 days) = -1
  - News about shelf offering = still hard reject (existing behavior)
- [ ] **NAC P&L Backfill Script** — Recalculate P&L for Jan 2-14 positions from stored entry/exit prices
- [ ] **Dedicated Log Files** — Separate logs for easier debugging (append mode, persist across restarts)
  - `warrior_trades.log` - All entries/exits/P&L events
  - `warrior_scaling.log` - Scale operations with PSM transitions
  - `errors.log` - All errors across strategies
